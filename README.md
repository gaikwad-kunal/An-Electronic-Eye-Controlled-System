# An Electronic Eye Controlled System
Security is a paramount concern in our day-to-day lives, especially when it comes to safeguarding our belongings and properties. This project introduces an efficient security alarm system that operates based on the intensity of light detected by a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). Traditional security systems available in the market can often be expensive, which may not be feasible for everyone. Hence, this project aims to provide an affordable alternative for securing cash boxes and lockers.

##Features
Utilizes a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to sense light intensity.
Low-cost solution for security alarm systems.
Can be easily integrated into existing cash boxes and lockers.
Provides effective protection against unauthorized access.
Customizable threshold for triggering the alarm based on light intensity.

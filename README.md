# An Electronic Eye Controlled System 
## "An affordable security alarm system utilizing light intensity detection for safeguarding cash boxes and lockers."

Security is a paramount concern in our day-to-day lives, especially when it comes to safeguarding our belongings and properties. This project introduces an efficient security alarm system that operates based on the intensity of light detected by a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). Traditional security systems available in the market can often be expensive, which may not be feasible for everyone. Hence, this project aims to provide an affordable alternative for securing cash boxes and lockers.

## Features

Utilizes a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to sense light intensity.
Low-cost solution for security alarm systems.
Can be easily integrated into existing cash boxes and lockers.
Provides effective protection against unauthorized access.
Customizable threshold for triggering the alarm based on light intensity.

## Components

  - Battery
  - Voltage Regulator (7805 IC)
  - Capacitor
  - LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
  - Resistor
  - NPN Transistor (BC547)
  - Diode(1N4007)
  - Buzzer (5v)


## Merits

 * With the electronic eye-controlled system, you can monitor, control and secure your home.
 * This application saves money and minimizes energy consumption.
 * It improves the overall efficiency of the system.


## Applications

 * This can be used in malls, jeweler shops and banks to provide security for cash boxes and
lockers.
 * This can be used in doorbell circuits.
 * This can be used in the garage door opener circuit.

## Conclusion 

Our proposed project is user-friendly. It can be easily implemented. The application of the
electronic eye in banks, schools, industries, hotels, residential buildings, etc. serves security
purposes. Hence the development of similar devices is necessary. It is relatively cheap.
